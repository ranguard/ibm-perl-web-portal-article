<h2>SUMMARY:</h2>
<p>
<em>Use Perl as a simple and powerful framework for your web site; this article will demonstrate how easy it is to get going and how to extend this for your own needs.</em>
</p><p>
Perl has been through a revolution over the last 5 years, this has been named 'Modern Perl'. One of the most significant changes has been a focus on frameworks, reusable code and a clean coding style.
</p><p>
We will be demonstrating how to create a web portal using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Plack/">Plack</a>, most  popular Perl frameworks integrate with Plack so it will be easy to integrate one of those later should you need it.
</p><p>
Plack is Perl superglue for web frameworks and web servers. Plack sits between your code (whether you use a web framework or not) and the web server. This means that you (and your framework) do not need to worry about specifics of a web server, and vice-versa.
</p><p>
Lets get you setup... we are going to use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/bin/cpanm">cpanm</a> (from App::cpanminus) to download and install modules into your <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm">local::lib</a> (so you do not need root access)
</p><p>
<h2>INITIAL SETUP:</h2>
<pre>
# get rid of any existing cpan configuration
mv ~/.cpan ~/.cpan_original
 
# Then one of the following:

# if you can run wget
wget -O - http://cpanmin.us/ | perl - local::lib App::cpanminus && echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
 
# OR if you can run curl
curl -L http://cpanmin.us/ | perl - local::lib App::cpanminus && echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
 
# otherwise, FTP up the contents of http://cpanmin.us to a file called cpanmin.us, make it executable and then run: 
./cpanmin.us local::lib App::cpanminus && echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
</pre>
</p><p>

You will now have a <code>perl5</code> directory in your home directory

We will assume you have root access to your server (although not actually rew)


use lib "/home/patrick/perl5/lib/perl5";
use local::lib;


</p><p>
Perl has a vast number of modules available for use on
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>. The only real problem
being to work out which are best to use. If you are lost at any
point <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Task-Kensho/">Task::Kensho</a>
