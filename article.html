<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>
<em>Use Perl as a simple and powerful framework for your web site; this article will demonstrate how easy it is to get going and how to extend this for your own needs.</em>
</p><p>
Perl has been through a revolution over the last 5 years, this has been named 'Modern Perl'. One of the most significant changes has been a focus on frameworks, reusable code and a clean coding style.
</p><p>
We will be demonstrating how to create a web portal using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Plack/">Plack</a>, most  popular Perl frameworks integrate with Plack so it will be easy to integrate one of those later should you need it.
</p><p>
Plack is Perl superglue for web frameworks and web servers. Plack sits between your code (whether you use a web framework or not) and the web server. This means that you (and your framework) do not need to worry about specifics of a web server, and vice-versa.
</p><p>
Lets get you setup... we are going to use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/bin/cpanm">cpanm</a> (from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/">App::cpanminus</a>) to download and install modules into your <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm">local::lib</a> (so you do not need root access)
</p><p>
<h2>Initial setup:</h2>
<pre>
# archive of any existing cpan configuration
mv ~/.cpan ~/.cpan_original
 
# Then one of the following:

# if you can run wget
wget -O - http://cpanmin.us/ | perl - local::lib App::cpanminus && echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
 
# OR if you can run curl
curl -L http://cpanmin.us/ | perl - local::lib App::cpanminus && echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
 
# otherwise, download the contents of http://cpanmin.us to a file called cpanmin.us, make it executable and then run: 
./cpanmin.us local::lib App::cpanminus && echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
</pre>
</p><p>
<h2>Setting up Plack</h2>
<p>
<pre>
cpanm Plack
</pre>
The <code>perl5</code> folder in your home directory will now have all the modules you need.
The next step is to create a .psgi configuration file which will allow us to return a
web page.
</p>
<p>

<a href="psgi_examples/1.psgi">1.psgi</a>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    # Tell Perl where our lib is (ALWAYS use this)
    use lib "$ENV{HOME}/perl5/lib/perl5";

    # local::lib sets everything up correctly from  (ALWAYS use this)
    use local::lib;

    # ensure we declare everything correctly (ALWAYS use this)
    use strict;

    # Give us diagnostic warnings where possible (ALWAYS use this)
    use warnings;

    # Code to run our application
    use Plack::Runner;

    # Code to validate that our application is configured correctly
    use Plack::Middleware::Lint;

    # A basic app
    my $app = sub {
        my $env = shift;
        return [
            200,    # HTTP Status code
            [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/html' ],    # HTTP Headers,
            ["All is good"]                       # Content
        ];
    };

    # Run checks that we have setup $app correctly
    $app = Plack::Middleware::Lint->wrap($app);

    # Create a runner object
    my $runner = Plack::Runner->new;

    # Pass in command line arguments (useful when developing)
    $runner->parse_options(@ARGV);

    # Actually run the application
    $runner->run($app);
</pre>
Save this to a file, called 1.psgi, then use the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Plack/scripts/plackup">plackup</a> command to start your web server from the command line as follows: 
<pre>
    plackup 1.psgi
</pre>
You will see:
<pre>
HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://SERVER_IP:5000/
</pre>
Using your web browser, go to http://SERVER_IP:5000/, if you are developing
on your desktop computer then <a href="http://localhost:5000/">http://localhost:5000/</a> will work.
You should now see a page with 'All is good'. In fact if you go to <em>any</em> page this is what you will see,
e.g. <a href="http://localhost:5000/any_page.html">http://localhost:5000/any_page.html</a> because
we are always returning this, irrespective of the request.

<h2>Further reasources</a>
<p>
Perl has a vast number of modules available for use on
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>. The only real problem
being to work out which are best to use. If you are lost at any
point <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Task-Kensho/">Task::Kensho</a>
